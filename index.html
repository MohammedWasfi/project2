        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Mohammed Wasfi. I live in the north side of Chicago.
          This is my second year at IIT as an ITM student. So far I am enjoying it
          here as I have a passion for programming and just the use of all sort of
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a very curious and determined person who enjoys learning about computers and technology. I put my best
          efforts in everything I do and try to gain as much knowledge as possible from all kinds of sources.
          Some of my hobbies include playing video games, playing soccer, designing on photoshop and basically anything that
          has to do with computers.
